# 🚗 APK-check application

I programmed an application where you can check the expiration date of your APK. 

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Now, you can start a local web server by running:

```
npm run dev
```

And then open  ➜ Local: http://127.0.0.1:5173/ to view it in the browser.
